\section{Sorting Methods}
We compare the time used by \emph{sort} and \emph{stable\_sort}.
\subsection{Description}
\emph{sort} usually implements the \emph{QuickSort} algorithm, whereas 
\emph{stable\_sort} usually implements \emph{HeapSort}.

We performed $100$ consective sortings on a vector containing all integers in the range
$[1, 10^{6}]$.

\subsection{Results}
We expected \emph{stable\_sort} to perform better, since conecutive sortings 
would trigger QuickSort's worst case; but QuickSort still performed much better.
